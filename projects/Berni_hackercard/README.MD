# Bernini's Hackercard

This is my hackercard, created by using KiCad instead of EasyEDA. It uses a NT3H2111W0FHKH NFC chip connected to an antenna in the PCB to communicate with external devices. It also features a LED that will light up when energized.

This PCB will cost $13.4 per card as I would like to use ENIG surface finish. (It has to use standard PCBA because Economic does not support ENIG)
